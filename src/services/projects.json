    "goals": "The main goal for this short project was to work with ReactJS and create a small SPA. The main characteristics it should have was to render the first projects of the rickandmortyapi alphabetically. After that, each character card should be clickable and show an information page with more trivia of the character. Also, a text input and some filters have been implemented so the user could search for the desired character. Also, I decided to add a landing page for the project and a random quote which is also generated by the same API."
